* ~ayeQ~: A toolbox for working with IQ modulation
This project aims to create a command-line program that allows the creation of
IQ modulated digital signals from different sources. These files can then be
plaid back on SDRs or analyzed with other programs. Our goal is to make the
generation of IQ signals easy for people using the command-line. We currently
support the following kinds of modulation/synthesis:

 - Amplitude Modulation (AM)
 - Carrier Synthesis
 - CW (Morse Code)

** Amplitude modulation
The AM module takes an input sound files, applies AM to it, then interpolates
the resulting IQ samples. The following options are allowed:

#+begin_example
  -i,--in-file INPUT_FILE  Input sound file
  -o,--out-file OUTPUT_FILE
                           Output IQ file
  -m,--modulation-index MOD_INDEX
                           Modulation index, value between 1-100 (default: 100)
  -u,--upsample-factor UPSAMPLE_FAC
                           Upsample factor, outSR = inSR * UPSAMPLE_FAC
                           (default: 10)
  -c,--cutoff-frequency CUTOFF_FREQ
                           Cutoff frequency, value in Hz (default: 15000)
  -t,--transition-width TRANS_WIDTH
                           Transition width, value in Hz (default: 10000)
  -h,--help                Show this help text

#+end_example

For example, suppose you wanted to apply AM to ~test.flac~, with an
interpolation factor of 15, you could use:

#+begin_example
$ ayeQ am -i ~/test.flac -o ~/out.iq -u 15
#+end_example

** Carrier Synthesis
Thie module generates a carrier at baseband for the requested length of time.
The following options are allowed:

#+begin_example
  -l,--length LENGTH       Carrier length in seconds
  -o,--out-file OUTPUT_FILE
                           Output IQ file
  -s,--sample-rate SAMPLE_RATE
                           IQ Sample rate in Hz (default: 1000000)
  -h,--help                Show this help text
#+end_example

For example, suppose you wanted to generate a baseband carrier for 10 seconds
with at a sample rate of 1MHz:

#+begin_example
$ ayeQ carrier -o ~/out.iq -l 10 -s 1000000
#+end_example

** CW

This module allows IQ files to be generated that encode textual data with the
standard more code.  The following options are allowed:

#+begin_example
  -s,--sample-rate SAMPLE_RATE
                           Sample rate of the produced IQ file
  -w,--wpm WPM_RATE        Rate of keying in Words per Minute (default: 25)
  -t,--in-text INPUT_TEXT  Input text message
  -o,--out-file OUTPUT_FILE
                           Output IQ file
  -h,--help                Show this help text
#+end_example

For example, suppose you want to generate a CQ call at a sample rate of 600kHz:

#+begin_example
$ ayeQ cw -o ~/cw.iq -s 600000 -t "cq cq cq de M0MLQ"
#+end_example
